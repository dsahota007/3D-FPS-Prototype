# 3D FPS Prototype (Created In Godot Engine)

This is an early prototype of a 3D wave-based shooter where you face off against relentless waves of enemies. Currently, the game includes a map with collisions, 
a base zombie model with hit detection, and an advanced AI system that allows enemies to follow the player intelligently.

This is still a work in progress, and more features like shooting mechanics, wave progression, and enemy variety will be added.
